Part 1: Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies
<br><br>
Problem Statement:</br>
In this assignment, you will be implementing an AR application step by step using planar
homographies. You will first learn to find point correspondences between two images and use
these to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography you will then warp
images and finally implement your own AR application.</br></br>

Steps done in this Part:
1. Getting Correspondences
2. Compute the Homography Parameters
3. Calculate Book Coordinates
4. Crop AR Video Frames
5. Overlay the First Frame of the Two Videos
6. Creating AR Application
<br><br>

Part 2 : Image Mosaics
<br><br>
Problem Statement:</br>
In this part of the assignment, you will implement an image stitcher that uses image warping
and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic. We will focus on the case where
we have two input images that should form the mosaic, where we warp one image into the plane
of the second image and display the combined views.<br><br>

Steps done in this Part: 
1. Getting Correspondences and Compute the Homography Parameter
2. Warping Between Image Planes
3. Create the output mosaic
